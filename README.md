   - Service: voice_automation_ai.create_automation
   - Data: description: "<user's description>"

   Examples:
   - "Create an automation that turns on the lights when I arrive home"
   - "Make the blinds close at sunset"
   - "Notify me when the front door opens"
   ```

3. Use voice commands like:
   - "Create an automation that turns on the living room lights when I arrive"
   - "Make an automation to close the blinds at 9 PM"
   - "Set up an automation to notify me when the door opens"

### Via Service Call

You can also use the service directly in automations or scripts:

```yaml
service: voice_automation_ai.create_automation
data:
  description: "Turn on the kitchen lights when motion is detected"
  preview: false  # Set to true to preview without creating
  validate_only: false  # Set to true to only validate
```

### Developer Tools

Test the integration in **Developer Tools** ‚Üí **Services**:

1. Select `voice_automation_ai.create_automation`
2. Enter a description
3. Call the service

## Examples

### Example 1: Motion-activated lights

**Voice command:** "Create an automation that turns on the bathroom light when motion is detected"

**Generated automation:**
```yaml
- alias: "Turn on bathroom light with motion"
  description: "Turns on the bathroom light when motion sensor detects movement"
  mode: single
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.bathroom_motion
      to: "on"
  condition: []
  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: light.bathroom
```

### Example 2: Time-based automation

**Voice command:** "Close all blinds at sunset"

**Generated automation:**
```yaml
- alias: "Close blinds at sunset"
  description: "Automatically closes all blinds when the sun sets"
  mode: single
  trigger:
    - platform: sun
      event: sunset
  condition: []
  action:
    - service: cover.close_cover
      target:
        entity_id: all
```

## Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| API Key | Your Anthropic API key | Required |
| Model | Claude model to use | Claude 3.5 Sonnet |
| Language | Language for generated automations | English |

### Available Models

- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (Recommended) - Best balance of speed, intelligence, and cost
- **Claude 3 Opus** - Most powerful, best for complex automations
- **Claude 3 Haiku** - Fastest and most economical
